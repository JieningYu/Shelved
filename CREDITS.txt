Minecraft Quilt: Credits/Thank You

Quilt is a set of tools and modifications to the Minecraft base game code to assist
mod developers in creating new and exciting content. It has been in development for
several years now, but I would like to take this time thank a few people who have
helped it along it's way.

First, the people who originally created the Quilt projects way back in Minecraft
alpha. Eloraam of RedPower, and SpaceToad of Buildcraft, without their acceptiance
of me taking over the project, who knows what Minecraft modding would be today.

Secondly, someone who has worked with me, and developed some of the core features
that allow modding to be as functional, and as simple as it is, cpw. For developing
Quilt Loader, which stabelized the client and server modding ecosystem. As well as the base
loading system that allows us to modify Minecraft's code as elegently as possible.

Mezz, who has stepped up as the issue and pull request manager. Helping to keep me
sane as well as guiding the community into creating better additions to Quilt.

Searge, Bspks, Fesh0r, ProfMobious, and all the rest over on the Loom team {of which
I am a part}. For creating some of the core tools needed to make Minecraft modding
both possible, and as stable as can be.
  On that note, here is some specific information of the Loom data we use:
    * Minecraft Coder Pack (Loom) *
      Quilt Mod Loader and Minecraft Quilt have permission to distribute and automatically
      download components of Loom and distribute Loom data files. This permission is not
      transitive and others wishing to redistribute the Minecraft Quilt source independently
      should seek permission of Loom or remove the Loom data files and request their users
      to download Loom separately.

And lastly, the countless community members who have spent time submitting bug reports,
pull requests, and just helping out the community in general. Thank you.

=========================================================================

This is Quilt Mod Loader.

You can find the source code at all times at https://github.com/Minecraftquilt/Minecraftquilt/tree/1.12.x/src/main/java/net/minecraftquilt/quilt_loader

This minecraft mod is a clean open source implementation of a mod loader for minecraft servers
and minecraft clients.

The code is authored by cpw.

It began by partially implementing an API defined by the client side ModLoader, authored by Risugami.
http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/75440-
This support has been dropped as of Minecraft release 1.7, as Risugami no longer maintains ModLoader.

It also contains suggestions and hints and generous helpings of code from LexManos, author of MinecraftQuilt.
http://www.minecraftquilt.net/

Additionally, it contains an implementation of topological sort based on that
published at http://keithschwarz.com/interesting/code/?dir=topological-sort

It also contains code from the Maven project for performing versioned dependency
resolution. http://maven.apache.org/

It also contains a partial repackaging of the javaxdelta library from http://sourcequilt.net/projects/javaxdelta/
with credit to it's authors.

Quilt Mod Loader downloads components from the Minecraft Coder Pack
(http://loom.ocean-labs.de/index.php/Main_Page) with kind permission from the Loom team.
